## Introduction
VoxArte Studio now offers a comprehensive auditory suite with the addition of two innovative denoising options. By leveraging powerful audio processing libraries, VoxArte Studio enables real-time and offline pitch shifting, voice speed modulation, robotization effects, and advanced noise reduction capabilities.

## Features
- **Audio Pitch Shift**: Real-time and offline processing, configurable pitch range, and command-line interface. can be accessed in ***Audio Pitch Shift*** directory.
- **Audio Speed Changer**: Adjustable speed without affecting pitch, real-time modifications, and batch processing.can be accessed in ***Audio Speed Changer*** directory.
- **Robotize Effect**: Customizable robotic timbre, real-time effect application, and digital pedalboard effects.can be accessed in ***Robotizer*** directory.
- **High Noise Removal**: Powerful denoising that may affect the speaker's voice but removes significant background noise.can be accessed in ***Denoisers*** directory.
- **Low Noise Removal**: A gentler denoising process that preserves the speaker's voice quality while removing background noise.can be accessed in ***Denoisers*** directory.
Both of ***Noise Removal*** methods can be used in real-time processing, allowing for noise reduction without latency, perfect for live applications.

## Installation
To get started with VoxArte Studio, ensure you have FFmpeg installed:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
pip install torch torchaudio torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

Then, clone the repository and install the Python dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amir-Nassimi/VoxArte-Studio.git
cd VoxArte-Studio
pip install -r requirements.txt #Exists in each directory
```

## Build and Test
Transform your audio files with these commands:

### Pitch Shift
```bash
python pitch_shift.py  --input [input audio file] --out [output directory] --temp [temp directory] --step [from -5 to 10] --start [optional - second] --end [optional - second] --format [optional - from format list]
```

### Robotize
```bash
python robotize.py --input  [input audio file] --out [output directory] --start [optional - second] --end [optional - second] --format [optional - from format list]
```

### Speed Change
```bash
python speed.py --input  [input audio file] --out [output directory] --temp [temp directory] --rate [from 0.5 to 2] --start [optional - second] --end [optional - second] --format [optional - from format list]
```

### Noise Removal
Please Download the [Weight](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L4exxzsACOx2cqA2AWdv6d77QnUM0E5s/view?usp=sharing) from following link and put it inside the VoxArte-Studio/Audio Denoisers/models dir

#### High Noise Removal
```bash
python3 high_denoise.py --input [input audio file] --out [output directory] --temp [temp directory] --format [output audio format]
```

#### Low Noise Removal
```bash
python3 low_denoise.py --input [input audio file] --out [output directory] --format [output audio format]
```

## Valid Formats
VoxArte Studio supports a variety of audio formats, including:
- ogg
- flac
- mp3
- aiff
- aac
- m4a

## Technology Stack
VoxArte Studio harnesses a collection of powerful libraries and frameworks to provide its audio processing capabilities:

- **FFmpeg**: A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.
- **Librosa**: A Python package for music and audio analysis, providing the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems.
- **Soundfile**: A library for reading from and writing to a wide range of audio file formats.
- **Torch**: An open-source machine learning library, a scientific computing framework, and a script language based on the Lua programming language.
- **Torchvision**: A package consisting of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision.
- **Torchaudio**: Provides easy access to audio processing in PyTorch.
- **Denoiser**: Likely refers to a specific library or tool for removing noise from audio tracks.
- **TQDM**: A fast, extensible progress bar for Python and CLI that can be added to your code in seconds.
- **OpenCV-Python (opencv_python)**: A library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.
- **Resampy**: A Python module for high-quality audio resampling.

Make sure to install all required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file - which exists in each project's directory - or manually install them with `pip` if necessary.
